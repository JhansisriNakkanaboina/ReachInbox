### About Project
When someone opens this application, they first see a sign-up page with a Google sign-up button. This page has a simple, dark-themed design. The Google sign-up button doesn't actually authenticate users but instead redirects them to the home page and create account button has not functionality.

Once on the home page, they'll see a basic UI that looks like WhatsApp, with a sidebar, a list of chats, and a chat window. However, nothing in the interface is functional—users can't send messages, click on chat items, or navigate to different sections from the sidebar. It's just a visual mock-up, giving the appearance of a WhatsApp-like app without any real functionality.
